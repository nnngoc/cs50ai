## Projects

1. Project 0: Search - Implement search algorithms like depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search to solve a word puzzle and a puzzle involving a maze.
2. Project 1: Knowledge - Build a knowledge-based agent using propositional logic to solve a puzzle and answer questions about a given knowledge base.
3. Project 2: Uncertainty - Develop probabilistic models using Bayesian networks to predict and analyze patient diagnoses and weather patterns.
4. Project 3: Optimization - Solve optimization problems using constraint satisfaction and linear programming techniques, including solving Sudoku puzzles and planning airline routes.
5. Project 4: Learning - Train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits and implement a machine learning model to play the game of Nim.
6. Project 5: Language - Use natural language processing techniques to implement an AI that can understand and generate Shakespearean text.

Feel free to explore the projects and continue your journey into the world of artificial intelligence with Python!
